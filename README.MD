Labyrinth is a traditional roguelike that uses composition over inheritance to create a dynamic world.


## Why?

I created this program to demonstrate to potential employers my understanding of C++ and object-oriented programming practices. I also like the idea of using composition over inheritance for this genre of game. It allows for elegant code and a greater possibility for emergent behavior.


## Controls

    Movement: Arrow Keys (+ Shift for diagonal movement), Numpad, Vi Keys
    Wait: Space, Numpad 5
    Pickup: p
    Inventory: i
